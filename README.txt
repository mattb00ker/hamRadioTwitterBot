AHHHHHHHH i hope this works!
It did

Plan for repo is to produce a twitter bot running on a raspberry pi. 
Job of the bot will be to harvest HF radio prop data and output it in plain 
text. This will be done twice a day most likely, inline with average sun 
up and sun down.

This will most likely be written in python as i've completed similar 
projects using that language.
